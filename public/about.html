<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Jee Ann Alqueza, 31 years old and I lived in the Philippines.
I graduated Business Administration Major in Management Accounting at Western Institute of Technology.
I experienced working on Hospital, Business Firms as a Secretary.
I do a lot of paper works, until I switched on teaching online. For me an online work is the best work if you have a family because you can have more time with them.
I want to grow as a person that's why I study Web Developer. And I think this Course will help me to be a professional web developer someday. </p>
